# pythoncode
This is a part of a python programming challenge that I had taken up.

Due to a non disclosure agreement, more information on the challenge cannot be shared but to give a gist, 
This challenge consists of two parts:
Part 1 : The goal of this challenge was to write a small program that handles the parsing and veriÔ¨Åcation of UDP packets, to demonstrate a small example of overall design architecture and code aesthetic.
Part 2 : the read up for the challenge is attached.
